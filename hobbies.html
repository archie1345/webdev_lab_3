                most of my hobbies are mainly sports cause i love to do anykind of activities that can help me to build my body and maintain my health.
                although i'm not the best at running or any cardio activity i still do those kind of activities and enjoys it.
                from all of my hobbies, i mainly focused on Taekwondo because it was fun yet challenging and over there i meet a lot of friends and gain a lot of experience
